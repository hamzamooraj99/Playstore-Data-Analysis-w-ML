# Understanding the differences, similarities, and key Characteristics of popular Playstore Applications in Pakistan and the US
Please read the EXECUTION.txt file to understand the order of executing the python programs to clean and refine the data, and also create the popularity index

## Introduction
This report analyses the key characteristics of popular applications in the Playstore of two regions; Pakistan and the United States. These characteristics are then compared with one another to understand what the demographic of each country is looking for when it comes to applications.

## Technology Used

 - Python is the main language used. It was used to refine the datasets and do the necessary analysis
 - I made use of the Pandas library to read and write to the dataset, as well as help with the Feature Importance ML Model data preprocessing
 - I used Matplotlib to create the charts for the analysis
 - Sci-kit Learn was used for the Feature Importance model
 - Finally, the Numpy library helped me with data preprocessing when building the Feature Importance Model

### For further information about the analysis, please read the Report which lays out my findings. It is located ./Report
